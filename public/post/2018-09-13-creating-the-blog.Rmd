before I forget I'll quickly jot down the sequence I took creating the blog. Will fill in the details later
Create a new repository in Github and clone/ download.
Copy the URL
in terminal cd to the directory in which you will create the project blog
git clone [paste url]
File, new project, existing directory
blogdown::new_site(choose your theme)
Git > diff > commit >push
into netlify and connect your repository

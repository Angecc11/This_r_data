<p>I thought I might start by listing the various courses taken and data science related topics I have learned about so far. Then cross reference by adding some tags and categories so it will be easy to refer to at later.</p>
<p>In the next post I will try and list the things the known unknowns! However I am sure there are loads of things I am not even aware of. As I come across things I will add them to this post.</p>
<p>Use headings, subheadings, images, bullet points.</p>
<p>The next post will outline what I want to learn - based at this stage on what I think I need to learn. The known unknowns! I’m sure there are plenty more areas I need to focus on.</p>
<p>I will start by going through the modules taken for the professional diploma. Then I will go through my folders and files for the rest. I will attempt to tidy up the folders as I go.</p>
<p>Professional Diploma in Data Analytics.</p>

<h3>Module 1: Data Analytics</h3>
<div id="introduction-to-data-analytics" class="section level4">
<h4>Introduction to Data Analytics</h4>
<p>Course Outline: Introduction, Types of Variables and Data, Sampling Descriptive Statistics: Graphical Techniques for Displaying Data &amp; Numerical Summary Measures Probability Concepts Random Variables and Probability Distributions Sampling Distributions Confidence Interval Estimation Hypothesis Testing Procedures: Single sample Hypothesis Tests and Confidence Intervals: Two samples The Analysis of Categorical Data Simple Linear Regression Analysis of Variance</p>

<div id="advanced-data-analytics" class="section level4">
<h4>Advanced Data Analytics</h4>
<p>Course Outline: - Probability distributions<br />
- Introduce the Exponential, Poisson, Beta and Gamma distributions<br />
- Discuss the practical and theoretical uses of the above probability distribution<br />
- Likelihood: Introduce the concept of likelihood and its role in the estimation of distribution parameters and their associated uncertainty - Bayesian inference: Incorporate prior information in the performance of parameter estimation using so-called Bayesian inference</p>
<p>Learning outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify the most appropriate probability distribution to model particular types of data<br />
</li>
<li>Estimate parameters and their associated uncertainty using likelihood methods and interpret these values in the context of real-world problems<br />
</li>
<li>Incorporate prior information into common statistical problems and obtain posterior distributions</li>
</ul>

<p>Data mining is the process of discovering patterns and structures in large datasets. It uses methods from statistics, computer science and machine learning.</p>
<p>It is more exploratory than multvariate analysis. The emphasis is on developing predictions from data.</p>
<p>Data mining has many practical applications</p>
<p><em>Business applications</em> Help companies intelligently organize and nd information Credit scoring Predict purchasing behavior Recommend products/services Develop trading strategies <em>Scientific applications</em> Predict disease occurrence Find predictive data features Simplify high volume data</p>
<ul>
<li>Elementary probability, Addition rule, conditional probability, independent events</li>
</ul>

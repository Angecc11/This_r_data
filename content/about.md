Welcome!

My name is Angela and I am learning R and data science through a bunch of online courses, tutorials and books. I began learning data science about 2 years ago when I went completed an online professional diploma in Data Science at UCD. Since then I have taken many moocs with coursera, edx, Datacamp as well as reading blogs and tutorials.

I have created this personal blog partly as a way of documenting my experience and keeping everything in one convenient reference place. There are so many resources out there that it can be all too easy to start learning one thing but get led astray by all the other things that there are to learn!
My computer file system is getting extremely cluttered with files and my browser has so many favourites and bookmarks. There has to be a better way.  I came across a post by David Robinson to aspiring data scientists which was to start a blog! 

I also hope to get more experience applying what I am learning to other problems and datasets that I find interesting. One way to do this is to get more practice at web scraping. 

Writing about it all as I go will hopefully focus my effort in a nore structured way  and maybe I will have something to show for my learning effort!.

I have found some very useful information from reading other peoples blogs so maybe one day I too can pay it forward.

My aim is to review the things I've already learned while also documenting the things I am currently learning as I go. I am not attempting to reinvest the wheel and where I find useful and informative resources online I will provide a link to them.

So in a nutsehll, something old, something new, something borrowed...!

I built this blog using the R package Blogdown and the [Hugo Blackburn theme] (https://themes.gohugo.io/blackburn/)) which I only came across while reading someone else's blog!


Thanks for reading.

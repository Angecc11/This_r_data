<p>Data mining is the process of discovering patterns and structures in large datasets. It uses methods from statistics, computer science and machine learning.</p>
<p>It is more exploratory than multvariate analysis. The emphasis is on developing predictions from data.</p>
<p>Data mining has many practical applications</p>
<p><em>Business applications</em> Help companies intelligently organize and nd information Credit scoring Predict purchasing behavior Recommend products/services Develop trading strategies <em>Scientific applications</em> Predict disease occurrence Find predictive data features Simplify high volume data</p>

<li>Elementary probability, Addition rule, conditional probability, independent events, complements, contingency tables, fréchet bounds,</li>
</ul>
<p>The Fréchet Bounds usually written as max{P(A) + P(B) − 1, 0} ≤ P(A ∩ B) ≤ min{P(A), P(B)}. The bounds are “tight” which means that there is no better lower or upper bound that holds generally.</p>

I came across the following excellent post by David Robinson on his personal blog [Varianceexplained.org] (http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/)

I found it to be a very useful article as it could have been  written just for me! When you are just learning things on your own it can be hard to know where you are and where you should be going. 

David provides a list of possible topics you could write about if you’re not yet working as a data scientist.

- Analyses of datasets you find interesting
- Intuitive explanations of concepts you’ve recently mastered 
- Explorations of how to make a specific piece of code faster 
- Announcements about open source projects you’ve released 
- Links to interactive applications you’ve built 
- Sharing a writeup of conferences or meetups you’ve attended
- Expressing opinions about data science or educational practice 

Well as I am not working as a data scientist then this seems like good advice to follow! The first 2 topics are where I will start. This will be a chance for me to deviate from the toy datasets that are usually used in courses and tutorials. 
David then outlines some reasons why writing a data science blog is worthwhile. 

- Practice analyzing data and communicating about it  
- Create a portfolio of your work and skills  
- Get feedback and evaluation

Skills to practice include 
- Data cleaning. Work with a variety of datasets
- Statistics: put statistical methods into practice, writing about it helps build your own understanding
- Machine learning: user predictive algorithms on various datsets and know why you would choose one over another  
- Visualization: improve your style when you have an audience   
- Communication: get experience writing and structuring a data-driven argument.

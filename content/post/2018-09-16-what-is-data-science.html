<p>What is data?</p>
<p><em>data are values of qualitative or quantitative variables, belonging to a set of items.</em> Source [wikipedia/wiki] (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/data" class="uri">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/data</a>)</p>
<p>What does data look like?</p>

<h1>Types of data science questions</h1>
<ul>
<li>Descriptive</li>
<li>Exploratory</li>
<li>Inferential</li>
<li>Predictive</li>
<li>Causal</li>
<li>Mechanistic</li>
</ul>
<p>Descriptive data analysis describes the data. Exploratory analysis ai,s to find relationships you were not aware of Inference uses a small data sample to say something about the bigger population Predictive uses data about one thing to make predictions about another object Causal analysis seeks to find what happens to one variable when you make changes to another variable. Mechanistic analysis seeks to understand the exact change in a variables that lead to changes in other variables for other objects</p>

<h1>Experimental design</h1>
<p>Key notes<br />
* Know and care about the analysis<br />
* Plan how and where to share data and code<br />
* Formulate the question in advance<br />
* Statistical inference<br />
* Variability<br />
* Confounding<br />
* Correlation is not causation<br />
* Randomizing and blocking<br />
* Prediction versus inference<br />
* Prediction key quantities<br />
* Beware data dredging</p>
<p>Good experiments have replication, measure variability, generalize to the problem you care about and are transparent.</p>

<h1>The Feynman technique</h1>
<p>I came across this blogpost by Venkat Raman. MSee blogpost at <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/want-to-become-a-data-scientist-try-feynman-technique-2ea010da1c54">medium</a> So I did a bit of research online and in summary:</p>
<p>There are four steps to using the Feynman Technique</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Choose a concept you want to learn about.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain it in your own words using as simple language as possible, perhaps including an example to show the concept in action. Your explanation should be able to teach the concept to someone else, even a child.</p></li>
<li><p>review your explanation from step 2 and identify any areas you are uncertain on or didnâ€™t explain clearly enough. Once you have identified gaps go back to your source material or examples and improve your own understanding of the concept.</p></li>
<li><p>Review your explanation to see if you could make it any simpler to explain to someone else who might not have your knowledge base of the topic.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now I am not sure how practical it is to apply this method to learning data science. From my learning experience to date, there is a lot of technical detail which cannot be easily translated into a non technical language. Therefore I will use a somewhat modified version of the Feyman technique and not expect my kids to understand it!.</p>
